				<p class="description">Cal Club Golf is a competitive team that represents UC Berkeley in the National Collegiate Club Golf Association. As Founder and President, I established the club in Fall 2013 through a series of proposals to the Sports Club Department. During practices every week and other pastimes, members of the team have a great time following through with their passion for golf and hanging out with fellow golfers.</p>

				<p class="description">The Delta Chi Fraternity is a social fraternity registered with UC Berkeley. Brothers of the fraternity get along great with each other and become very close friends, whether you live in the Delta Chi house or not. Through this group, I have found both a sensible and smart group of friends who know how to have an awesome time.</p>
